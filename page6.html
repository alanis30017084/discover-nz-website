            <p>Were I able to travel anywhere else in the world, I would Visit Japan.<br>
            I've always admired the architecture of the old temples and shrines, including the striking colours and intricate design.
            <br><br>If, like me, you were most interested in the scenic historical buildings and nature, I would choose Miyajima Island in Hiroshima as my first destination.
            <br>On Miyajima Island is the five-storied Pagoda, Gonjunoto, the colours beautifully contrasting the hills behind, as well as the sharp detail of the pagoda behind a soft green backdrop of flora.
            <br><br><img src="images/miyajima_pagoda.png" style="width:100%;">
            <br><br>From the Pagoda you can also see the well known Itsukushima shrine which, located far out in the water, appears to be floating.
            <br>I've seen it on numerous postcards and simply had to find out more, leading me to discover this amazing destination in Hiroshima.
            <br><br><img src="images/miyajima.png" style="width:100%;">
            <br><br>If one wanted to fully immerse themselves in the nature however, I think the Bamboo forest in the Arashiyama district in Kyoto would be an amazing experience.
            <br>One could take a walk through this lush green and then spend the rest of the day visiting Kyoto's old shops and restaurants, or continue to explore its nature walks and gardens.
            <br><br><img src="images/kyoto.png" style="width:100%;">
            <br><br>Finally, I would enjoy the food and nightlife of Osaka, quite close to Kyoto in fact.
            <br>Being open until late into the night, the streets are still crowded with people, alight with colour, shapes, music and the delicious aroma of its cuisine.
            <br><br><img src="images/osaka.png" style="width:100%;">
            <br><br>I plan to travel there with friends these summer holidays. The language is quite easy to learn with logical structures and consistency in spelling and pronounciation, far easier than english.
            <br>The writing system, where I mean the symbols (katakana, kanji and hiragana) is a minor hurdle and learning extensive kanji is not nessesary if you intend to simply be a tourist in japan.
            <br>Happy travels!
